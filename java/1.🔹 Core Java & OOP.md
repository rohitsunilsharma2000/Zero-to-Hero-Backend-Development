## ðŸ§­ CORE JAVA LEARNING ROADMAP (Beginner to Advanced)

---

### âœ… PHASE 1: Java Fundamentals (Beginner Level)

#### ðŸ“˜ Topics
- JDK & IDE setup (IntelliJ recommended)
- Data types, variables, operators
- Control flow: if-else, loops
- Functions & recursion
- Arrays & Strings

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-Time Project
- **Student Grade Calculator**: Input student marks and generate report cards (uses arrays, methods, and string manipulation)

---

### âœ… PHASE 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### ðŸ“˜ Topics
- Class vs Object, Constructors
- `this`, `super`, static and final keywords
- **4 Pillars of OOP**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism
- Method overloading vs overriding

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-Time Project
- **Library Management System**  
  Track books, members, issuing history using OOP concepts.

#### âœ… SOLID Principles (in OOP)
| Principle | Concept | Java Example |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **S** â€“ Single Responsibility | Class should have one reason to change | `BookManager` vs `BookPrinter` |
| **O** â€“ Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification | Abstract classes, interfaces |
| **L** â€“ Liskov Substitution | Subtypes should replace base types | `Dog extends Animal` |
| **I** â€“ Interface Segregation | Split large interfaces | Use smaller interfaces |
| **D** â€“ Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions | Constructor injection |

---

### âœ… PHASE 3: Core Java Advanced

#### ðŸ“˜ Topics
- Exception Handling (`try-catch-finally`, custom exceptions)
- Wrapper classes and autoboxing
- Java Collections (List, Set, Map, Queue)
- Generics

#### ðŸ’¡ Real-Time Project
- **Inventory Tracker System**  
  Track products using `HashMap`, `ArrayList`, and exception handling.

#### ðŸ§  Key Design Patterns Introduced
| Pattern | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Singleton** | One DB config instance |
| **Factory** | Creating product instances |
| **Strategy** | Sorting, filtering logic change at runtime |
| **Observer** | Notification systems |



## âœ… PHASE 4: Java Multithreading (Deep Dive)

### ðŸ§  Why Multithreading?
Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more threads. Itâ€™s essential for building **high-performance**, **responsive**, and **scalable** Java applications â€” especially in systems like real-time trading, messaging platforms, or microservices.

---

### ðŸ“˜ Core Multithreading Topics

| Topic | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `Thread`, `Runnable` | Two ways to define threads | `new Thread(new MyTask()).start()` |
| Thread Lifecycle | New â†’ Runnable â†’ Running â†’ Blocked â†’ Terminated | Useful for thread state monitoring |
| `synchronized` keyword | Prevents race conditions | Sync shared method/block |
| Thread Communication | `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` | Producer-Consumer pattern |
| Thread Pooling | Avoid thread creation overhead | `ExecutorService`, `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10)` |
| `Callable` and `Future` | For returnable + cancellable tasks | `Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(callable)` |
| Concurrency Utils | `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `CyclicBarrier`, `ReentrantLock` | Advanced control for concurrent access |
| `volatile` keyword | Ensures variable visibility across threads | Use in flag variables |
| Deadlock, Starvation | Common concurrency pitfalls | Always acquire locks in same order |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Real-Time Mini Projects

1. **Multithreaded File Downloader**
   - Each thread downloads one file.
   - Uses `ExecutorService`.

2. **Restaurant Order System (Producer-Consumer)**
   - Chef thread (producer) prepares dishes.
   - Waiter thread (consumer) serves.

3. **Online Exam Timer**
   - CountDownLatch for managing submission deadline.

4. **ATM Simulator**
   - Multiple users accessing shared balance using synchronized block.

---

### ðŸš« Common Interview Pitfalls

| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Race Condition | Two threads modify same variable without sync |
| Deadlock | Two threads waiting on each otherâ€™s lock |
| Livelock | Threads actively respond to each other but no progress |
| Starvation | Low priority thread never executes |

## âœ… PHASE 5 (Continued): Design Patterns â€“ Deep Dive

---

### ðŸ“˜ What Are Design Patterns?
Reusable solutions to common software design problems, especially useful when working in a team or designing scalable systems.

| **Factory** | Delegate object creation | Pizza Store: VegFactory, NonVegFactory | Payment Gateway selector |
| **Builder** | Step-by-step object construction | HTML builder | Report or complex object creation |
| **Prototype** | Clone existing object | Resume template cloning | Clone cached object |
| **Abstract Factory** | Group of related factories | GUI: WindowsFactory, MacFactory | Widget library selector |
