---

## 🔹 1. **IPO (Initial Public Offering) Management**

### 🧑‍🏫 Layman Explanation:

Citi helps private companies become public by listing them on the stock market. This involves planning the IPO, estimating company valuation, assigning underwriters (like Citi), and filing with regulators.

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Create, view, and update IPO requests.
* IPOs go through various statuses: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `FILED`, `CLOSED`.

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class IPORequest {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String companyName;

    private BigDecimal expectedValuation;

    private LocalDate plannedDate;

    private String underwriterBank;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private IPOStatus status;

}
```

---

## 🔹 2. **Mergers & Acquisitions (M\&A) Deal Tracking**

### 🛠️ Technical Features:

* Submit risk assessments
* Link to IPO/M\&A/Underwriting records
* Assign compliance officers

### 🗃️ JPA Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class RiskAssessment {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String associatedDealType; // IPO, M&A, etc.
    private Long referenceId; // ID from associated entity

    private String riskCategory; // CREDIT, MARKET, LEGAL
    private String findings;
    private String mitigationPlan;

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

Use Tailwind's responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:`) and `Grid` layout for:

* Collapsible sidebar
* Card-based views on mobile
* Mobile filter panel with off-canvas

---

## 🔁 Integration with Spring Boot APIs

Use `services/api.ts` for encapsulating all API requests:

```ts
// services/ipo.ts
export const createIPO = (data) => axios.post('/api/ipo-management', data);
export const getIPOs = () => axios.get('/api/ipo-management');
```

Secure with Bearer token (JWT):

```ts
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
```

---

## 📊 Dashboard Example (Banker Home Page)

* KPI Cards:

  * Total IPOs filed this quarter
  * Active M\&A deals
  * Deals under compliance review
* Charts:

  * Deal funnel (IPO → Underwriting → Market)
  * ESG score trends (bar chart)

Would you like:

* A **sample Next.js page** for one of the modules (e.g., IPO management)?
* A **starter repo** with all folders and pages pre-generated?
* A **Postman collection** for Spring Boot endpoints to connect the frontend?
